# User Login/Registration with React Hooks & Redux

This project is just a template and you would still need to create the backend yourself.

## Libraries I used for the Backend

- express (if using node)
- cors (communication between frontend and backend)
- bcrypt (for user password)
- jsonwebtoken (token used to authenticate user)

## Note

- I do have an "AxiosPath.js" file cause I also intend to used it with "electronjs" which only runs locally
